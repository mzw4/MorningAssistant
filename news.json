A combination of ignorance and irrationality on the part of Al Jazeera higher-ups hindered the venture from the very beginning.

Cable channels normally rely on ads and per-subscriber fees, but \"few if any cable providers were actually paying AJAM for carriage, and ad sales were virtually nonexistent.\" ", " Mohamed Nanabhay, who ran Al Jazeera's English-language web site for years, said the odds were always stacked against the American venture. \"From the start, it was a bet against all the things Al Jazeera was doing well,\" he said.

But Current was an awfully shaky foundation to build on. One big distributor, Time Warner Cable, dropped the channel right away, citing a change in ownership clause. Other distributors looked for ways out. ", " And staffers at Current had the sense that Doha didn't know what it had just bought. Evan Cutler, who worked on Joy Behar's Current TV show, recalled how a group of Al Jazeera executives visited the channel's dilapidated studios at 33rd Street and 10th Avenue a few days after the deal was announced. ", " \"The feed of Current TV was on in the lobby, and one of them remarked about how crappy the monitor was, thinking it was just a bad feed,\" Cutler said.

", " Moreover, it had practically no audience, so Al Jazeera would be starting almost from scratch. ", " The deal was done in January 2013. In order to appease distributors, Al Jazeera ", " instead of simulcasting the newscasts AJE was already producing. That triggered a hiring spree. The channel bragged of receiving 18,000 applications for 170 jobs. Journalists projected their hopes and aspirations onto Al Jazeera; the channel was thought to be a refuge from ratings stunts, tabloid programs and penny-pinching corporate overlords.

I loved being able to tell people you wouldn't see a Kardashian story on our station.\" ", " ", " Mitchell was there for the", " along with hundreds of others. O'Brian, the channel's president, was a 30-year veteran of ABC. David Doss, the head of news programming, was a veteran of ABC and CNN.

One of AJAM's distributors, AT&T U-verse, ", " so Al Jazeera dragged the company into court. Meanwhile, Al Jazeera blocked U.S. access to the beloved AJE live stream and angry messages piled up from people accustomed to watching their AJE shows. ", " But the network's bosses had little choice. If Al Jazeera wanted a spot on cable \u2014 if it wanted to be paid a monthly per-subscriber fee by cable providers, just like CNN and Fox \u2014 it couldn't give away an Internet stream. This was just one of the many stipulations in the carriage contracts. ", " \"We couldn't stream the show called 'The Stream,'' one staffer marveled. \"We were launching in a situation where we couldn't win.\" ", " Azmat Khan, who reported and produced for Chen's show \"America Tonight\" for a year and a half, called it a \"stunning miscalculation.\" ", " \"Despite outcry from its own staff, Al Jazeera gave in to cable demands time and again,\" she wrote on Facebook. It wasn't just the locked-up live stream: \"Every video published online had to be taken down within seven days,\" Khan wrote. \"Amidst the rebirth of podcasts, most audio was a no-go; same with video animation.\" ", " Some digital staffers even threatened to quit. But the cable operators had all the power. ", " There were still other obstacles. It is now conventional wisdom among employees, according to those interviewed for this story, that Al Jazeera America should have changed its name.

They didn't listen to people who knew the U.S. market.\" ", " Al Shihabi, the man appointed to run AJAM, told skeptics that his research supported the name and showed it was not a hindrance. But the network was clearly sensitive about the concerns. A pamphlet that circulated among staffers one month before launch focused on AJAM's \"brand messaging.\" When it came to the new channel's voice, employees were urged to \"make it American.\" ", " \"Communicate in a way that speaks to and of America,\" the pamphlet said. ", " The foreign name and the onerous cable contracts were trouble enough. But some staffers, looking back, believe the channel could have overcome these hurdles if not for management failings. Most of their fingers pointed at Al Shihabi. ", " Al Shihabi had previously shepherded the launches of Al Jazeera Balkans and Al Jazeera Turk. He brimmed with confidence at the time of AJAM's launch, expecting that the channel would immediately siphon viewers from competitors. ", " One on-air personality said management's view was \"if we build it, they will come.\" They didn't. ", " ", " ", " Doha funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the channel, but the Nielsen numbers barely budged. While Al Shihabi publicly downplayed the importance of the ratings, he fretted behind the scenes and repeatedly sowed doubt about the accuracy of the data. He also sought other ways to justify the investment. ", " For a while, his favorite word was \"influence,\" according to several people who worked closely with him. Some employees were required to check a box each time they filed a story indicating whether or not it had \"influence.\" ", " ", " Al Shihabi's former life as a management consultant was evident in his memos, checklists and PowerPoint presentations. His intent was to gauge AJAM's impact, which he could then highlight to the leadership in Doha. \"He was always selling Doha a new story,\" one of his deputies said. If it wasn't \"influence,\" it was awards or access to newsmakers. ", " \"Our impact is reflected not in numbers necessarily, but in the end result of a chain of events triggered by our reporting,\" Al Shihabi wrote in a February 2015 memo. The memo told AJAM's top producers to \"track the impact of our reporting on society and submit a weekly report, every Tuesday, to Kate O'Brian.\" The directive left its recipients perplexed. ", " Other memos reviewed by CNNMoney were borderline unintelligible. ", " Al Shihabi \u2014 who did not respond to interview requests \u2014 operated with great autonomy in the United States, with no real number two, and relied heavily on outside consultants to validate his strategy. High-ranking employees described him as a highly unpopular figure. He presided over a \"culture of fear,\" AJAM senior vice president Marcy McGinnis said after she resigned in May 2015. ", " That's the month that everything came to a head. A fired employee had filed a lawsuit, alleging the channel was rife with anti-Semitism and sexism. And two other ", "had resigned right before McGinnis,", "including Dawn Bridges, the head of communications.

He ", "the head of AJE. ", " \"I am confident Al's leadership will transform the channel's ability to lead in the U.S.,\" Souag said. ", " Newsroom employees were jubilant about Al Shihabi's ouster. \"It's like the Arab Spring in here,\" one staffer said in an email to a friend. \"Everyone's openly celebrating.\" Anstey steadied the ship pretty quickly, according to numerous staffers, while O'Brian remained in charge of the newsroom. The duo (who declined interview requests for this story) were a much better match. They were optimistic about the slowly rising ratings and they enjoyed strategizing about the channel's next five and even ten years. ", " But it was too late for any of that. ", " By the summer of 2015 \"Doha began to understand that the media environment surrounding the network was changing,\" a senior source said. ", " \"Word was coming back that Doha was unhappy,\" a high-ranking executive in New York said. ", " \"We just kept bleeding money,\" said a third. The channel was spread out in three locations in Manhattan, and it had a costly long-term lease for a fourth location, on West 55th Street, that it never moved into. (One staffer said the lease cost AJAM at least $1 million a month.) ", " By August, the board of directors was reviewing all of the channel's major financial decisions with an eye toward cutting back. With oil prices falling, Qatar decided it needed to spend less on Al Jazeera's many networks around the world. ", " Doha's scrutiny of AJAM came to a head in December. \"They had to cut, and instead of making it across the board or anywhere else, they decided to chop AJAM,\" a Qatari source said. ", " In some ways the timing is convenient. High-priced talent contracts are set to expire soon, since many of the anchors and executives signed three-year deals back in 2013. And some key distribution deals are also approaching end points. ", " But there will still be substantial costs associated with winding down the channel. Some of the distributors are likely to demand penalty payments because the channel will be breaking its carriage contracts. ", " ", " On Wednesday the 13th, when word spread about an ominous all-hands meeting, Velshi was in Washington, D.C. for the previous evening's State of the Union coverage. From there, he had planned to take a flight down to Charleston, S.C. to cover the next GOP primary debate. But he hopped on a train back to New York City instead. ", " Velshi's staff had stood up for him when Al Shihabi tried to fire the anchorman. He wanted to be there when the curtain fell. \"I wasn't able to save their jobs, but I wanted to see them and tell them personally that I will see them through until the end and help them find their next thing,\" he said. ", " In recent days there has been an outpouring of pride among AJAM staffers, pride in what they've done and what they attempted to do. Many feel it was a worthwhile experiment. O'Brian ", "and called the timing \"bittersweet.\" ", " But along with pride there is also exasperation. If AJAM had been the first streaming news channel instead of the final cable news channel, would the outcome have been any different? ", " \"Going back three years, I don't think we yet saw that streaming was absolutely going to be the future,\" a senior source admitted. ", " But Al Jazeera did make a side bet on streaming at the same time it launched AJAM. It set up ", "an online video startup in San Francisco that churns out news stories and distributes them via sites like Facebook. Its growth rates are impressive; AJ+ is having \"influence,\" as Al Shihabi might say, for a fraction of the cost of AJAM. ", " Doha has noticed, and it is ", "while shutting down the cable channel. ", " \"The problem was that Al Jazeera's audiences were always digital. They were never coming to cable,\" a former staffer said. ", " A senior Qatari source said that in retrospect Al Jazeera should have never launched AJAM. Instead of starting a new channel and seeking a per-subscriber fee for it, Doha should have paid cable operators to carry the existing Al Jazeera English channel. Fox News similarly paid for carriage in its early days. Some distributors might have balked, but Al Jazeera had enough money to make it work. ", " \"That's what they should have done with all those millions in 2013 \u2014 pay the operators,\" the source said. \"It would have been infinitely cheaper, we'd still have all our online fans we had, and it would have avoided all these poor staffers losing their jobs.\" ", " About 700 people are expected to be leaving in April.
